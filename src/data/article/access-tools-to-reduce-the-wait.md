## The Two-headed Beast: Booking and Availability

In our first article, we introduced the healthcare consumer journey and explored the research phase. Today, we move the token one space to the right, into the Booking phase to address the challenges of access.

![The five phases of the healthcare consumer journey](/assets/images/healthcare-journey.jpg)

Access is complicated. It involves two core elements which each have their own challenges: booking process and availability. To the consumer, only the booking process is felt directly, but that process is largely controlled by availability issues that occur on the provider side of the equation. Ultimately, both should be invisible to the consumer. A consumer shouldn’t perceive any hurdles in the Booking phase.

Getting to the level of seamless booking that consumers have come to expect in other areas of life — like booking a table at a restaurant or a haircut — may not be around the corner. However, we can start to reduce the challenges presented by access by first understanding the issues and then working toward new, tech-led solutions.

## The Booking Process: Please Hold for Next Available Teller

Too often health practices resist change and remain locked into antiquated booking processes. A patient that wants to make a simple appointment calls in, is put on hold, then is prompted to leave a message for someone who will return their call. Easy enough, except it doesn’t end there. When the scheduler calls back, the patient will often miss the call, sending them back into the cycle ad nauseum until they give up. That may be extreme (or maybe it feels commonplace), but in this workflow it’s clear the patient’s needs come second to the convenience of the scheduler. The patient is expected to put their life on hold just to schedule an appointment. And this is supposed to be okay.

### The Path to Progress

Antiquated booking processes present major challenges for patients, but it’s an easier problem to solve than those found in the realm of availability. At this stage, we simply need tools to aid patient convenience.

The first place we can look is obvious: online scheduling. However, this is not as simple as it seems. While some practices have begun to adopt online appointment scheduling, this is typically available only to current patients who have registered for the provider’s EHR. Even then it is unlikely the full transaction can be completed online. It is more likely that the online _appointment scheduling_ tools is actually an _appointment request_ tool. These tools require the patient to wait while a proper time is selected for them and confirmed. This is a step in the right direction, but adds little more convenience than the traditional call in / call back model.

Making an appointment with a doctor is not the same as booking a table at a restaurant. Appointments vary in length, complexity, and dependencies. You may not be able to schedule a single doctor if the care you need is cross-functional. There are also certain times of day that are required if you need certain types of appointments. And the availability of a doctor can shift without warning. Moving patient scheduling to the web is complicated, but it’s not impossible.

Before getting to web-based scheduling, there are other ways to start to streamline the booking process. To begin, instead of routing everyone to a unique scheduler for each doctor, you can move toward a call center or centralized scheduling model.

When you shift to a centralized model, you not only add convenience for your customers, you also start to provide a consistent experience. When you provide a consistent experience, you can start to measure the effectiveness of current practices, experiment with new methods, and share best practices across your suddenly more connected system. Moving in a new direction allows you to shift from a process rooted in routine to an optimized process that focuses on error-reduction, patient satisfaction, and efficiency.

To really make a difference, you first must take away the idea of the individual. A single person that is responsible for scheduling a doctor’s time will always produce a doctor-centric, patient-inconvenient system.

On the digital side, instead of requiring someone to talk on the phone, you can implement chat on your website for booking and simple questions. Chat is relatively simple to implement and provides a convenient alternative for people who either do not want to talk on the phone or cannot talk on the phone. When well-staffed, a chat tool provides more immediate results than the call in/call back model. It also prevents errors of transcription, as the person taking the information from the patient can see everything clearly spelled out and does not have to try to guess what was said.

For practices that offer online appointment booking, one of the ideas that healthcare can borrow from the world of ecommerce is to <a target="_blank" href=“http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button”>make account creation optional</a>. When companies require that a user create an account before they can make a purchase online, they see lower adoption. By not requiring an account, purchases are made easier, and therefore happen more frequently. In healthcare, by allowing prospective patients to request appointments (or better, schedule them) without first registering for an EHR, the prospective patient has an easier path to conversion and a better initial experience with the practice. Additionally, by making this first connection digital, you’ll begin to collect information that can help reduce the barriers to registering for an EHR.

The key in each of these ideas is that the booking process needs to shift from provider’s convenience (in time of day and channel) to patient’s convenience. Once you shift to that mindset, the opportunities and benefits reveal themselves.

This is the first two-way interaction that a potential customer has with your healthcare organization. It should be exceptional. It should set the tone for how easy working with your organization will be for all interactions that follow.

But booking is only part of the challenge of access. The real hurdles are all about availability.

## Beyond Booking: The Availability Challenge.

Easier booking is only half the battle when it comes to access. If it is easy to make an appointment, but you cannot see a doctor for three months, then the value is significantly reduced. This is the real heart of the challenge when it comes to access. We don’t live in a world with an infinite supply of doctors available anytime and anywhere we need or want them.

In theory, a team of data-sharing doctors with a consistent set of practice standards could take on a more fluid staffing model. By sharing data (really, really good data) and methodologies, the particular doctor becomes less important. This means the doctor you see for your first appointment and the one you see for a follow-up, or even a procedure, is the first one available, and you don’t have any reason to care.

But that’s theoretical. The practical world we live in demands a little more continuity and is more reliant on relationships.

There are also factors beyond data sharing to consider. There are several specialties that are <a href=“http://www.asco.org/sites/www.asco.org/files/socca_infographic_-_web_lowres.pdf” target=“_blank”>projected to fall short of patient demand</a> in the near future, due to either increased incidence of conditions, decrease in doctor supply, or both.

If you want to make the availability problem worse, live in a remote area where access to doctors, particularly specialists, is severely limited.

We can’t solve all of the problems, but we can start to push some of the first dominoes that help the others fall.

The area most ripe for an access upheaval is primary care.

### A Gallon of Milk and a Physical

There is a growing trend amongst retailers that helps with this issue: <a href=“http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/12/retail-clinics_n_6445506.html“ target=“_blank”>retail clinics that take on primary care functions</a>. Started by pharmacies like CVS, and more recently gaining traction from <a href=“http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2014/08/08/health-care-for-4-walmart-unveils-new-primary-care-clinics/“ target=“_blank”>Wal-Mart’s onslaught of clinic openings</a> in rural areas, the retail clinic is an answer to part of the problem of availability.

As retail clinics grow to absorb the low hanging fruit of the primary care practice, doctors in traditional settings will be able to focus on the patients that need them the most. There are things that can easily be taken care of at a clinic run by a hospital that just happens to be in a Wal-Mart or a CVS. Things you can walk in for. Doctors should rejoice. Patients have access and doctors can focus a little more on each patient’s needs.

But this is also a threat to doctors. Many doctors are incentivized not for the complexity of work, but for things like throughput. Though concepts like <a href=“http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2015/04/01/as-value-based-care-escalates-cvs-eclipses-50-hospital-deals/” target=“_blank”>value-based care</a> aim to change that, for some, these retail clinics are seen as a threat.

Some pundits have gone as far as saying that we are nearing <a href=“http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/11/03/is-this-the-end-of-primary-care/“ target=“_blank”>the end of the primary care doctor</a>. The end of the primary care doctor may be far from reality today, but the end of the traditional primary care doctor model is just around the corner.

On the flip-side, some traditional physician offices will learn from their new competitor set and adopt some elements of the retail experience as their own. This can only benefit patients, as retail is perhaps the best example for creating an always-on, customer-centric brand. If anything will push the medical world to move into digital and better customer tools and services, it will be the forced marriage with retail.

Taking this a step further, if we see a lesser need for traditional primary care doctors, and instead allow more of the demand to fall to alternative practices, we will likely see a continued decrease in the number of new primary care physicians. Instead, some of the medical students that would have gravitated toward primary care will find themselves in other areas of medicine, which will help close the availability gaps for a range of specialties.

### Breaking Geographic Barriers

A rural Wal-Mart offering basic services is a great start for both patients and doctors. But, it’s not everything. You won’t find your oncologist in a Wal-Mart and realistically you wouldn’t want to. No, there are some things that must take place in a hospital or other inpatient facility. If you live in a rural area, the mega-hospital, or the surgery center will not come to you. That is not going to change anytime too soon, but we can change how we connect with patients before and after the required travel (if there ever is any). We can use technology.

The emergence of telehealth — the practice of medicine, including diagnosis over video chat, email, or other means — is a major boon to patient experience, but has not fully realized its potential. One of the common objections to telehealth is that it does not reach the right patients. The logic to the objection is that telehealth services are for smartphone carrying, wealthy, urbanite millennials, who just happen to be the consumers that often use the least healthcare services. Essentially, the investment is wasted because the users do not exist.

We will cover the real obstacles to adoption in an upcoming post, but the lack of a potential audience is false logic. There have been some positive examples that span demographics. Lower income patients have been some of the highest-rate adopters of text messaging services, such as <a href=“https://www.text4baby.org/about/data-and-evaluation” target=“_blank”>text4baby</a>, and adoption of smartphones in the US is <a href=“http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-one-a-portrait-of-smartphone-ownership/“ target=“_blank”>rising for all consumers</a> — elderly, rural, and low income included — not just wealthy, young urbanites. Further, in a related context, the <a href=“https://hbr.org/2015/06/using-data-to-increase-patient-engagement-in-health-care” target=“_blank”>elderly are actually using portals</a> and other provider-based technologies as frequently or more frequently than younger audiences.

What’s more, consumers are clamoring for services that make connecting with their doctors more convenient. In surveys <a href=“http://www.healthitoutcomes.com/doc/of-patients-prefer-doctors-who-email-0001” target=“_blank”>93% of respondents say they prefer doctors who connect with them via email</a>. We are at the beginning of this change, but good progress has already been made. In addition to successful text services and emails, we have started to see doctors consulting 24 hours a day via video chat at places like <a href=“http://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/cleveland-clinic-launches-24-hour-telemedicine-service” target=“_blank”>the Cleveland Clinic</a> and even <a href=“http://healthexperienceproject.com/the-doctor-will-stream-you-now/“ target=“_blank”>streaming their procedures online</a>.

Video chat can become the new triage. Instead of picking up the phone and talking to a nurse, a video chat lets a practitioner quickly establish whether or not a potential patient should come in, thus saving everyone time and money and ensuring those that truly need care are seen.

## Assembling the Toolbelt

![The Access Toolbelt](/assets/images/access-toolbelt.jpg)

Access is a multi-front war. To truly create an exceptional experience, health systems need to take on both the process of booking — through chat, online booking, and distributed scheduling practices — and the availability challenge — through telehealth, retail clinics, and better data sharing practices.

We are starting to see the beginnings of a sea change, where patients are empowered to choose when and how they connect with their doctors, how they make appointments, and whether or not they use a traditional care facility. The traditional model is eroding. Healthcare providers can either go down with the ship or embrace new strategies and technologies that put the patient first.

## What’s Next?

In our first post, we tackled a key aspect of the Research phase: finding a better doctor. Today, we started to unpack access in the Booking phase. From here, we’ll focus on ideas that span the consumer journey. In our next post, we’ll look at digital tools and ideas that can help bridge the health literacy gap, and improve both doctor-patient and internal health system communications.
