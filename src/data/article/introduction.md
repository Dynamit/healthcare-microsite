## Users First

At Dynamit, great user experience is the core of everything we create. Over the past several years, we’ve seen a monumental shift; exceptional digital user experience has begun to lead expectations for all customer experiences. Digital now sets the bar for the experience expected of all touchpoints.

It wasn’t always this way. When the web began, it was the thing added on to your customer experience. It was an appendage, not the core. In the early days, companies tried to replicate the “real world” experience to try to make users comfortable in the new digital world. This is where the idea of skeuomorphic design was born. A great early example is the original Southwest airlines website which was designed to look like a ticket counter.

Today, roles have reversed. The physical ticket counter is held to the standards of the digital experience. Everything must be fast, efficient, and personalized.

Part of the reason we have seen such a sea change is that in the early days of the web, the real world connection was still the customer’s first exposure to the brand. Everything that followed was designed to support that first touchpoint. Now, we don’t always know where the first touchpoint will occur, but we know it’s often not an in-person interaction. We’ve shifted to a digitally-led introduction to businesses. In this new digital introduction, customers are more informed and more easily able to evaluate multiple options before they select a brand. The experience that consumers have with your company in any digital form now sets the bar for what is expected in real life. In other words, the web has changed everything we know about customer experience… almost.

While digital’s impact has been felt in nearly every industry, one is surprisingly behind. <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends" target="_blank">Mary Meeker’s annual internet trends report</a> notes that digital has only begun to make an impact on healthcare. The report estimates that while digital has almost completely changed all consumer-oriented industries, healthcare has only seen about 25% of the transformation it will see. There’s certainly plenty of talk of digital changing healthcare, and plenty of momentum in certain areas, but as a whole, it’s just the beginning.

In this four part series, we focus on digital ideas that can shape the healthcare customer experience. We are focused on hospitals and provider care, not pharma, not medical devices, or any of the other various outlets that comprise the full purview of healthcare. Those are important topics, but we begin with a look at the area where digital has had the greatest impact in most industries: the customer experience. It’s time to stop focusing on doctor priorities and to think about the customer. It’s time to ditch the appendage of digital and make it the core of healthcare experience.

## What We’ll Cover

Over the next several weeks, we will release one article every other week focused on a different aspect of healthcare.

We start today with a look at how users find doctors and how we might enhance that process in a way that’s more meaningful for both the patient and the provider.

Next week, we’ll dive into the murky waters of access. We’ll take a look at how we can rethink booking and how access can be improved by non-traditional means.

From there, we get into health literacy, improved communication, and creating more effective content to reach your audience.

Lastly, we’ll cover one of the biggest hurdles to any attempt at using digital to support healthcare: adoption.
