## Let's Talk

Our previous articles examined concepts specific to particular points in the healthcare consumer journey. Today, we break the mold and explore an idea spanning the entire continuum: communication.

This isn't our first mention of clearer communications. In our first article, we briefly discussed ways healthcare systems can more clearly communicate with consumers during the research phase by shifting away from tools that require elevated health literacy. But there's much more to communication. Health systems must consider communication strategies before treating a patient, during treatment, and after a patient is treated. These communication strategies are not always doctor to patient strategies. There are also system level communications to consumers and intrasystem communications. But like everything we've done so far, we begin with the consumer.

## Hi, I'm [Insert Health System Name].

We've said it before, but it's worth repeating: your website is your introduction to your customer. It is the primary place where your system communicates with potential customers during the research phase of the consumer journey.

_"We've shifted to a digitally-led introduction to businesses." - <a href="http://healthcare.dynamit.com/article/introduction">Dynamit</a>_

This intro sets the standard for how your system will communicate with its patients. You need to start setting the right standard. The problem is that too often health systems take a distributed approach to content. Each practice and doctor writes their own practice description and biography with little guidance. This is asking for inconsistent, doctor-centric language throughout the site, which is difficult for users to understand and navigate.

This is the content strategist's equivalent of cooking without a recipe. You get great results sometimes, but you also end up with inconsistencies and the occasional disaster.

Instead of this wild west strategy, marketing and communications teams must provide clear, situational guidelines. Develop a content style guide to help anyone writing for your website achieve an end result that supports the entire system's goals, and communicates appropriately with the end user.

One of the best examples of a web content style guide is Mailchimp's <a href="http://voiceandtone.com/" target="\_blank">Voice & Tone</a>. This living style guide helps onboard copywriters by providing guidance for a wide variety of situations. This particular style guide works well because it starts with the user. Each content type is matched to a scenario, and each scenario is driven by user needs and feelings. This model helps create empathetic content. You first think about what a user is experiencing at the time of interaction, then you write the content to match their needs.

Taking this concept to a healthcare context is straightforward, though the scenarios can quickly multiply. The best place to begin is with an audit. Catalogue all of your existing content and all of your distribution channels. Then marry the two and add in your guidelines.

Developing this type of tool takes time, and it's only as good as the guidelines you put forth. But it can become highly valuable. When you frame things in terms of the consumer and write for the consumer, verbose, jargon-laden descriptions begin to disappear.

For even greater clarity, you can make use of tools like <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="\_blank">Hemingway</a> to check your content's reading level. If you hit a reading level greater than 8th or 9th grade, consider revising.

The value of these tools only increases when they are expanded to serve more than one purpose or in more than one phase of the consumer journey. Develop guidelines for digital communications that occur both pre and post care.

## Take Out Your Doctor-Speak Decoder Ring and We'll Get Started

Better copywriting and living style guides may be the key to successful system communications. But the most important communications happen in person.

You can't completely blame doctors for poor communication. The human brain can only hold so much information and act in so many ways. It's natural when you start to gain more information and insight, older paradigms become forgotten and less relevant. So, when you've spent so much of your time operating as a physician and learning all the ins and outs of the complicated practice of medicine, it can be hard to communicate in a meaningful way to someone without a doctorate in medicine.

However, that's exactly what doctors must do. Or at least someone who supports the doctor. Patients need to be communicated with in terms they understand. They need someone who can talk to them in a way that acknowledges their health literacy level and explains medical matters in simple, clear language.

This isn't merely a matter of customer service. This is a matter of life or death. And it's a matter of billions of dollars.

A <a href="http://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/healthpolicy/CHPR/downloads/LowHealthLiteracyReport10_4_07.pdf" target="\_blank">report by George Washington University</a> estimates the cost of low health literacy is somewhere between $106 billion and $238 billion. The way a patient is or is not communicated with affects their ability to care for themselves, their ability to seek help when needed, and to refrain from visiting the doctor when they don't need help. All of these potential issues lead to increased healthcare costs. Take for example, the patient who doesn't understand instructions for taking a prescription and thus takes the medication incorrectly. This patient is far more likely to be readmitted, either because the medication is ineffective as taken or because a more severe issue develops.

In the modern medical practice, patients are <a href="http://khn.org/news/15-minute-doctor-visits/" target="\_blank">seen for shorter periods of time</a> and <a href="http://www.apta.org/PTinMotion/News/2014/10/8/HospitalizationStudyHCUP/" target="\_blank">stay in facilities fewer days</a>. This means the onus of care is shifting toward the patient. The patient is expected to do more at home, but they aren't prepared for this.

Assuming trends continue, and the burden of care shifts further to patients, it is increasingly important that we address the health literacy divide.

This starts with an idea similar to what we've proposed for web copywriting: a style guide.

Invest in a style guide for patient communication. Teach practitioners to think and talk like a patient. Develop training around communication and ensure everyone has a style guide for communicating with patients.  

Once practitioners and patients are communicating in the same language, it becomes much easier for doctors and patients to interact and for feedback to be shared across the table. During the care process, this means allowing time for questions, and asking patients to explain what they've been told to ensure they know how to care for themselves.

Taking this further, practices can adopt an <a href="http://www.myopennotes.org/" target="\_blank">OpenNotes</a> program to share a doctor's notes through a secure portal. The seminal study on this practice reveals that <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1363511" target="\_blank">97% of patients feel more comfortable and confident when they can see their doctor's notes</a>.

Practitioners have to play more roles than simply clinician. They are also educators. They are teaching their patients how to care for themselves when they leave the facility. To that end, consideration needs to be made for the many ways in which people learn. <a href="http://www.jcu.edu.au/wiledpack/modules/fsl/JCU_090460.html" target="\_blank">Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning styles</a> should be included.

When <a href="http://www.3d4medical.com/splash/" target="\_blank">3D4Medical</a> was paraded on stage at Apple's most recent product unveiling, it may have been for its technical innovation, but the app is designed to improve health literacy and care understanding for millions of visual learners (this is also a part of why we suggest <a href="http://healthcare.dynamit.com/article/relationships-finding-the-right-doctor/">switching the toolset provided for doctor research</a> to include tools with strong visualizations).

In the modern-health landscape, doctor and patient roles are evolving. As the balance shifts from inpatient care to DIY care, doctors must embrace new tools for their new role as educator.

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

There is one more type of communication which needs to be perfected for all of this to work, intrasystem communication. Practitioners and staff members need to communicate with one another and share information in a safe, secure way.

As healthcare demands increase without a comporable increase in supply, practicioners conintue to squeeze more patients onto their schedules. If these practioners see more people — often for shorter time periods — and then send patients off to care for themselves, doctors and other medical staff need to better prepared to make the most out of each appointment. They need better preparation and better data sharing. They need to come into each appointment with a plan and a complete data set.

The problem in most systems today, is that the tools for sharing information and communicating across teams have not evolved at the same pace as those found outside the healthcare industry. Instead, patients find themselves repeating the same information to each person they encounter. Some of this is for security, but often it flows from a lack of communication.

### Embrace New Tools for Better Communication

As a doctor runs from room to room, appointment to appointment, can they be expected to fully review the case history of the next patient on their schedule? If they were, what would this do to the overall patient experience? Is it worth making all patients wait longer, or to reduce the number of appointments that can be scheduled, to hold slightly more informed appointments?

What if doctors could be more informed, keep the same number of patients, and make each appointment more meaningful? That may sound idyllic, but it's coming close to becoming a reality.

A few shifts in the enterprise technology landscape are making this happen. First, the adoption of chat in the enterprise. As more companies begin to adopt team communication solutions, like <a href="https://slack.com/" target="\_blank">Slack</a> (sorry, <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/572507701734998017" target="\_blank">not HIPAA compliant</a>) and <a href="https://www.yammer.com/" target="\_blank">Yammer</a>, the ability to share data quickly and easily is increased. When this is paired with the second shift — an enterprise mobility strategy — employees, including doctors and other practitioners, can begin to share data anywhere, anytime. Add to that the increasing popularity of wearable devices — e.g. Apple Watch — and the patient prep becomes as easy as a glance at your wrist as you walk to the next room. All thanks to better data sharing, through better communication tools.

## TL;DR

The way healthcare organizations communicate with patients is critical. It can be a matter of life or death, and it can be a matter of billions of dollars. To make the most of communications, start with clear guidelines for both copywriting and in-person communications that emphasize clear, plain language. And don't be afraid to share information, both with patients and within your organization. The more that is shared, the more comfortable everyone is with the care provided.

## And Then We Came to the End

Our final post in this series is a mere two weeks away, and it's an important one: adoption. Over the first three articles, we've explored ideas to take on various challenges, but none of these ideas matter if they aren't adopted. In our final post, we'll explore issues of healthcare technology adoption and what you can do to overcome these challenges.
