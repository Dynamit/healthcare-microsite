## User, Meet Experience

When we started this journey six weeks ago, we told you about [Mary Meeker's annual internet trends report](http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends) which claims Healthcare is only 25% of the way to its forthcoming digital transformation. Healthcare is a broad topic, so we've focused on healthcare consumer focused tech.

To find the adoption rates of consumer-focused healthcare tech, we can look at additional studies, like one [by Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/form/industries/2015-state-connected-patient.jsp) that finds only 10% of consumers use the web, email, or text to setup appointments.

From this and more research, we draw conclusions about low adoption of healthcare tech by consumer.

This was a foundational element to our insights, but until now we've steered clear of why adoption is low or what to do about it. Instead, we looked at an idea for improved doctor selection, and told of tools spanning chat, telehealth, style guides, OpenNotes, and enterprise mobility. Some of these tools exist today, others will soon. None are particularly prevalent. None occupy the status quo for interaction with health systems.

Today, we get into the why. Why are we stuck at 25%? Why aren't any of the trends becoming status quo? And we'll look at what can be done to move the needle, to enable digital to drive the consumer experience in healthcare.


## It's the Demographics, Right?

The obvious answer to *"Why is adoption slow?"* is demographics. Or so it seems. Healthcare spending is disproportionately high for the [the elderly](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Age-and-Gender.html). The elderly are less likely to adopt new technologies, as evidenced by studies of things like [smartphone ownership](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-one-a-portrait-of-smartphone-ownership/). If you combine these facts, you could conclude the market for digital healthcare simply doesn't exist.

But it's not that easy. In the previously mentioned study released by Salesforce, 71% of millennials said they want to use healthcare apps for booking, test results, and doctor communication. This is supported, but also contrasted by a report from Athenahealth, an EHR provider, which finds those in the Millennial set are the [highest adopters of portals](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/08/10/the-current-state-of-patient-portal-adoption/), but still have an adoption rate in the 30% range (excluding the youngest set, which has an even lower rate).

In other words, Millennials say they want to use more digital tools, but they aren't making good on their promise.

Even if they did, Millennials represent one of the groups spending the least on healthcare — for now anyway. You could look at this fact and assemble the puzzle pieces in your mind. Millennials will use digital healthcare tools when their time comes, but until such point we should expect low adoption.

However, Millennials' low use of portals is not too far off from the usage by those in their 50s and 60s. This fact suggests digital healthcare adoption can be as nearly as high in any age demographic. In other words, age demographics don't provide our answer.

### Follow the Money

If you look at other demographics, particularly financial demographics, you find a clearer of technology adoption challenges.

"Medicaid patients are roughly 70% less likely than commercially insured patients to use a patient portal, a disparity that has the potential to widen the gap in health outcomes between wealthy and disadvantaged patients." - [Todd Rothenhaus M.D., Athenahealth](https://hbr.org/2015/06/using-data-to-increase-patient-engagement-in-health-care)

The above quote paints a dismal picture of the current state of digital healthcare for the economically disadvantaged, but even this isn't universally true. There are examples where the poor are using health portals and other technologies. [Text4Baby](https://www.text4baby.org/) — a service providing tips and information to pregnant women and new moms — is held up as a shining example of a digital program designed specifically for economically challenged consumers.

Key to the success of Text4Baby is the service does not rely on a desktop computer or even the internet. Instead, it relies on text messaging (as the name implies) to connect with patients. That is really the key: to connect with an audience, you must understand the needs, abilities, and behaviors of the audience. In this case, the user behavior doesn't support a model that relies on someone seated at a desktop computer connected to the internet.

### Research First

A success like Text4Baby texts understanding of the target audience. To gain an understanding of your audience, you have to do your homework. This could be as intense as a long-term ethnographic study, or it could simply mean looking into existing studies.

For example, imagine you are planning to create a portal for a hospital in an economically challenged area, where you know the vast majority of patients are on medicaid. You know you will build a web version of the portal that is accessible from desktops, but you aren't sure what to do about mobile.

To find your answer, you could dig into demographics of [smartphone usage](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-one-a-portrait-of-smartphone-ownership/). In doing so, you would see patterns supportive of some technologies but not others. You would find that your target consumers are somewhat unlikely to have a smartphone, but also far more likely than others to be reliant on mobile phones for internet access. This demographic's adoption trajectory doesn't include traditional desktops and laptops. They are natively mobile.

For our hypothetical portal, you would consider mobile web as a primary tool — and you'd want to consider a [progressive enhancement approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) to ensure even consumers on traditional cellular phones (non-smartphones) are able to perform basic functions on their phone's browser. Native apps are fine, but they exclude those without smartphones, and low income consumers who do buy smartphones often select versions with a smaller amount of storage, putting apps at a premium.

Unfortunately, the portals of many health systems are designed to work only on desktops. This is likely a contributing factor to the drastic difference in portal usage for medicaid patients.

### Consumer Does Not Equal Target

But there's more to the demographics puzzle. In our example above, we identified our target and designed solutions to meet the needs and behaviors of the target. But defining target can be tricky.

In many industries, a team can look at the consumers of their products and draw a circle around them as their target audience. This is not true in healthcare. You need look no further than the previously referenced Text4Baby to find an example. While the child may be the consumer, the parent makes decisions. This continues for many years, leaving some to call Moms the [true power-user of digital healthcare](http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/2015/08/27/how-these-tech-forward-moms-are-driving-digital-health/). But a funny thing happens later in life, when more healthcare services are needed, there's a switch and the child becomes the caregiver for the parent. In this light, a smartphone usage rate by the elderly of 27% seems less important. Instead, if you step a generation back to see the relatively high and consistently climbing use by those in the 50-64 year old set and the even higher rate of adoption by those 30-49, you find the potential reach for mobile solutions and digital health in general is actually pretty significant.

Demographics are important, they help us determine what types of applications and programs we should develop to increase the likelihood we reach our target audience, but they don't tell us why adoption rates are low. They tell us only that adoption is possible.

## If You Build It… They Won't Care
After you've done all of your homework, you've researched your key demographics, decided on the best course of action to reach your audience, and built a solution, what then?

This is where we finally get to adoption. Everything up until this point only makes adoption possible. Unfortunately, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to adoption. Instead, we offer a playbook. Five ways to make your digital health solutions more likely to be adopted.

### 1. The Barrier Breaker
One of the easiest ways to get people to use an application is to just let them use it. That is, to not require anything of them for its use. The fewer steps between the user and the app, the more like they are to use it. ([It sure works well in ecommerce](http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button).)

At every step between a user and an app, ask yourself: "Is this absolutely necessary for a user to use the app?" If the answer is no leave whatever it is — form field, registration step, etc. — out.

### 2. The Good Job!
Particularly for internal tools, like the chat tech we discussed in our [communication post](http://healthcare.dynamit.com/article/communication), recognition can be a powerful thing. To get employees to adopt technology, consider a recognition and reward program.  If employees can receive recognition from co-workers or supervisors from within an app, and use that recognition in a meaningful way — e.g. by collecting points to trade in for small things, like gift cards — they'll have more reason to use the app.

This can work for external-facing applications too, though reward programs can get tricky with consumers. They are more likely to drive adoption, but not retention.

### 3. The Package Deal
For transactional programs, think like a retailer. For instance, telehealth video conferencing. It's a tech program, likely with an app, but it's also a transaction. Pricing that allows a patient to buy credits or hours, leaving them with high likelihood of having leftover credits, or giving them free credits after purchasing the first block of credits, provides incentive to continue to use the service. If you give a user 30 minutes free when they purchase the first 15 minutes of a video chat, then see them for 15 minutes, they have clear incentive to come back to the service. Or at a minimum, they don't have any reason not to.

### 4. The Friend
When Facebook launched, it wasn't the best technical solution available. Conversely, Google+ launched with a pre-populated network, state of the art tech, and an SEO-hook to get corporations on board. Which one took off and which one stumbled out of the gate? Facebook of course. It was a runaway success because of its ability to build a network. Google+ tried to force it, and, for that and other reasons, is [in the process of failing](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-links-and-reviews-dropped-from-google-search-results/141262/).

And what about more recent successes? Slack, WhatsApp, SnapChat? What do they all have in common? They connect people. They connect friends. To grow, they need a network. They need network effects.

Guess what. So do you.

In the day of community health, allowing users to connect with one another and to push one another to reach goals, is a boon to adoption for certain apps — particularly wellness apps.  

### 5. The "Let Me Show You Around"
Lastly, don't forget to help your users out a bit. Onboarding, through quick tutorials and instructional overlays, can help new users get acclimated to your application, increasing the likelihood they will use your application.

Ideally, onboarding isn't necessary and you'll create an application so evident in its usage any onboarding will feel unnecessary. But the reality is many of the users served by healthcare applications will need some help. At least initially. Remember, Healthcare is at the inception of its digital transformation. Your users are too.   

## Make it Last

Getting users and keeping users are different tasks. This article is about adoption, but we would be remiss if we didn't mention retention. Keep these three tips in mind when considering retention rates:

1. __Remember the Users.__ Think of user behavior patterns. This is key to adoption and retention. If you are creating a native app for appointment reminders, but your population only comes in once a year, the app strategy feels a bit off. Instead, email and web based solutions will see higher retention in this situation. Match the behavior to the user to the solution.

2. __Make it Important.__ The applications we rely on most are the ones essential to our daily lives (or jobs). We feel compelled to remove the addictive game we downloaded last week because it takes over our lives, but we can't realistically cut off email. It's too essential. If your application provides some essential functionality to a user's daily life, it's a lot more like to be retained. In the world of healthcare, this might mean something like a digital version of your health insurance card or quick access to your medical history so consumers don't have to struggle to recall the same info every time they visit a new doctor.

3. __Check In.__ Don't forget to write from time to time. A friendly reminder (or notification) helps your users recall your application and continue to use it. If for nothing else to clear the annoying red number one from their home screen. This prevents regression to the mean — a return to previous behaviors, which would not include usage of a newly procured app.

## The Journey Never Ends
The foundation for this year's healthcare series has been the consumer journey, with the premise that we can use digital to reshape the experience of the healthcare consumer. To do this, we have to understand the journey, enhance it at every step, communicate clearly with consumers, and make sure you reach your audience. It's a tough task, but has worked successfully in many other industries. Healthcare needs this change. More than any other industry, healthcare needs a more informed and connected population. It's not a matter of profit and revenue — the focus of industries that have undergone successful transformations — it's a matter of health and well-being. What could be more important?
