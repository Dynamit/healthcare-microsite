## Enhancing the Healthcare Consumer Journey

At Dynamit, we believe digital can enhance every step of the healthcare consumer’s journey. To understand what that means, we first have to outline that journey. While not every healthcare consumer will follow the exact same path, the traditional journey consists of the following:

![The five phases of the healthcare consumer journey](/assets/images/healthcare-journey.jpg)

After a consumer establishes that they have a need, which is generated by a triggering event (e.g. a symptom or moving to a new city) the consumer will often start a research process. After conducting enough research to feel confident, a consumer will book an appointment, receive care, and then enter into either aftercare or general wellness maintenance. When a new need arises, they’ll start the process over.

The research process takes on a few forms, including general symptom research and provider research. The research phase isn’t as long as the research phase for a car or house purchase, but it’s more involved than a quick trip to Yelp to pick out what’s for dinner. A <a href="https://ssl.gstatic.com/think/docs/the-digital-journey-to-wellness-hospital-selection_research-studies.pdf" target="_blank">2012 report from Google and Compete</a> reveals that 48% of consumers spend more than two weeks in the research phase before they make an appointment with a healthcare provider. While these researchers browse a variety of resources, 76% of them visit hospital websites in the process of finding a provider.

This is a high value decision for the consumer. It’s a matter of their life, or their child’s life, or their family’s wellbeing. They take it seriously.

This is also a high value decision for the provider. This could lead to a negative interaction and a single visit with no chance of return, or it could lead the consumer and their family to use a single healthcare system for all care.

For both the provider and the consumer, a single system with a highly-trusted care coordinator has many advantages. Staying in a single system benefits a patient in terms of convenience, continuity of care, and consistency of experience. While it’s not always easy for a patient to move around within a single system, it’s even more challenging when they want to move data between systems.

For the provider, in addition to the financial benefits of having a lifelong patient, there are also care quality benefits. By having someone stay within a single system, all of their data is collected together in a way that tells a better story for the provider.

## Making Research More Valuable

In the current state, the material healthcare systems make available to prospective patients as they conduct research is lacking. Patients can research what insurance a practice takes, they can see where their potential doctor went to school, what papers they've written, and they can assess convenience factors — like location and hours. What they can't do is gain any insight into one of the key predictors of the likely success or failure of a doctor-patient relationship. They cannot assess whether or not their personality will work with their potential doctor.

In a sterile, robotic world this wouldn’t matter. Every doctor-patient relationship would be based purely on outcome and efficiency. But we live in a world where decisions are often based on feelings and opinions. If we trust and like our doctors, we may be more willing to listen to them, and more forgiving if they misunderstand something. We’re more willing to recommend them, and we’re more willing to go to them first when new needs arise. If we get the relationship right, we can actually cut out the research phase entirely when we have new needs. Instead, the patient will go to their trusted team and ask them where to go.

On the flip-side, if we don’t view our doctors favorably, the margin for error is zero, even when the errors are immaterial. One small mistake and the patient will go elsewhere, even if it is a pain to pick up their data and move it to a new system. They’ll also tell their friends of their experience and do everything they can to steer potential patients away from your practice.

Doctor-patient relationships represent a big risk. A visit to the wrong doctor turns a potential lifelong customer of a system into a patient that won’t return for a second visit. A missed connection potentially means many thousands of dollars in lost revenue over the lifetime of a single patient. But it’s only human. You work with people you trust and like working with. You find your way to providers that you connect with.

How do you make sure patients find their way to a doctor they are well matched with? A doctor that creates a lifelong customer? You start to embrace the power of relationships and create digital tools that better predict success.

## Doctor-finding Tools Need to Get Personal.

A 2013 <a href="http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/OMED-2013-finding-dr-right-new-survey-reveals-word-of-mouth-most-used-resource-when-looking-for-a-physician.aspx" target="_blank">study by the American Osteopathic Association</a> reveals that bedside manner is the top factor for selecting a physician outside of insurance acceptance. Additionally, a <a href="http://www.apnorc.org/PDFs/Finding%20Quality%20Doctors/Finding%20Quality%20Doctors%20Research%20Highlights.pdf" target="_blank">2014 study by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> shows that the majority of Americans focus on doctor-patient relationship when asked to describe a high-quality provider.

If we know that relationship factors are important for both finding doctors and sustaining relationships, and we know that patients are visiting hospital / physician websites in their research process, why aren’t hospitals making personality information available?

The vast majority of hospital systems, in addition to other providers, provide doctor-finding tools as one of the available research tools on their websites. These tools are usually a mix of drop-down lists and radio buttons that allow a potential patient to find a doctor by criteria like “specialty,” “location,” and “gender.” That’s a fine start, but these are not high impact criteria for sustained relationships with a practice. They are the minimum ante. In some cases, they aren’t even that. Some of the more refined tools in this category go a bit further and offer criteria such as “insurance accepted” (if it varies within a system) and “available days” (which surely varies). Even still, it’s tough to build a relationship knowing only the doctor’s specialty, gender, location, the days they work, and the fact that they take your insurance. I can picture a terrible relationship with those facts in the background, just as I can picture a successful one.

For personality analysis, patients rely on doctor rating sites and word of mouth. But the issue with both of those tools is they rely on individual experience. The wrong doctor for one patient can be the right doctor for another. The factors important to you and the personality traits that you value may vary from what a complete stranger on a doctor-rating site values or even what your next door neighbor, co-worker, or best friend values.

#### It’s Time to Get Personal. (After all, these people may ask you to take your clothes off.)

To transform the doctor-finding tools found on healthcare system websites into something more valuable for the patient and the provider, we need to shift our perspective. Stop thinking about the options that make sense to the provider and start thinking about the options that make sense to the patient. The options that are relevant to forming a lasting relationship. Without getting too “Match.com for doctors,” providers can start to inject some personality and humanity into the way doctors are found and the information available about each doctor. <a href="http://www.pardeeselect.org/" target="_blank">Pardee Select</a> is one example of how something like this works. The tool provided by UNC Healthcare’s Pardee Hospital allows visitors to make selections from a number of personality trait dichotomies, such as “serious” v. “relaxed,” to help hone in the right doctor. Pardee also provides video clips of each doctor to give the user a great sense of the doctor’s personality.

Whether or not dichotomous questions are the right approach for any particular practice is a matter of understanding the specifics of the practice. But, what feels right about Pardee Select is the introduction of more than sterile facts to help a consumer make the right decision.

It may be tough to accept, but where a doctor went to school, the papers they’ve written, and the awards they’ve won are often not predictors of success with specific patients. Success is based on more human factors. As a <a href="https://www.advisory.com/research/market-innovation-center/expert-insights/2015/what-drives-consumer-loyalty-to-a-primary-care-physician" target="_blank">report by The Advisory Board</a> (restricted access) puts it: “Manners beat credentials.”  

But there’s more work to be done than simply injecting personality questions into the doctor-finding tools. This is the first interaction that a potential patient has with your brand. Your website needs to set the standard for service. The drop-down select lists that are all too common on doctor-finder tools are overused and often unclear. They tend to imply questions — like what very specific type of specialist do you need? — that are more advanced than the typical user with average health literacy will understand. The options are presented in terms that are familiar to doctors, but foreign to the patients that they purport to serve. They also aren’t particularly mobile friendly — <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1950" target="_blank">requiring more taps to complete an action that  most alternatives</a>.

Instead, guide your users to the right doctor. Ask simple questions that a person without intimate knowledge of the medical profession can answer.

![Guided doctor search illustration](/assets/images/guided-search.gif)

You may even start to let your site do some of the work for you. Qualify patients by asking them to identify their symptoms, and then tell them what doctor they may need to see. Or package up their information and send it to their primary care physician so that their appointment can be more efficient and meaningful.

This type of high-touch interface can help alleviate a portion of the health literacy gap. The patient may not know exactly who they need to see, or their symptoms may not be clear to them, but if they have easy to use tools to help them on their way, they will have a better chance of ending up in the right place.

There are many ways you can start to connect patients with the right doctors. Whether that means the right personality to foster a long relationship, or simply the right doctor to diagnose and treat their symptoms.

Sometimes, the right doctor will just be the one that’s available right now. That’s okay, and that should be an option, but it doesn’t hurt to get a little more personal when providing the right match can create a lifelong relationship with a medical system.

## What About the Access Issue?

In our next post we'll cover the topic of access, focused on both booking and availability, but it's worth mentioning a tie-in here. One could argue that letting people choose the best fit could lead to the most personable doctors getting overloaded and others having excess capacity, thus introducing an access problem.

This is a concern that can easily be avoided. First, not everyone likes the same type of personality when it comes to finding a doctor. Having a diverse group of physicians so that patients can get into see the right doctors, or close enough to the right doctors, will alleviate the problem of everyone choosing the same person. Further, when doctors can’t take on new patients, they can simply be listed as unavailable and the next best match can become the best available.

Ultimately, it comes down to whether you are more concerned with avoiding the work it potentially takes to implement a system that provides a better match for your patients, or you are willing to take the plunge and reap the rewards that better, lifelong relationships can create for a system.

##  Where to Next?

This is just the beginning. We’ve discussed only one aspect of the first step in the healthcare consumer decision journey, albeit, an important one. Finding the right doctor is the foundation for a long-term relationship with a health system.

Next week we’ll move into the Booking phase of the consumer journey and look at the various challenges related to access. From there, we’ll move into issues that span all stages of the journey. All with an eye to creating a better patient experience by leveraging better digital tools and enhancing processes.
